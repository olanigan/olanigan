### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Tech Pragmatist who is cautiously excited about the potential and rapid growth of Generative AI and MLOps (LLMOps)
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a couple of open-source projects that involves Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM Fine-tuning and inference.
I'm always on the lookout for the best & latest GenAI tools along with Open-source LLM rankings and research.
