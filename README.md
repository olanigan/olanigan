### Ibrahim Olanigan 👋

**Full-Stack AI Engineer | Building Production-Grade LLM Systems | AI Educator & Open-Source Contributor**

I'm a Full-Stack AI Engineer with 9+ years of experience bridging the gap between scalable software architecture and production-grade AI. My focus is on building robust, real-world applications that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs), with deep expertise in RAG systems, agentic workflows, and Voice AI.

I am passionate about sharing knowledge through my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@IbrahimOlanigan) and contributing to the open-source community, especially in advancing AI for underrepresented languages.
